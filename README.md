Xomata

collection of scripts I mostly wrote.
some not made by me like Ares.

Many of the current scripts are for scanning and exploiting. As well as bruteforcing campaigns, Ideally for a server.

TODO: convert Ares into a webshell botnet, refine scripts, setup emailer tool, build a command line interface to make use of all of them.
